## Connect4
### [Play the game](http://connect-four-in-a-row.herokuapp.com/)
This is my implementation of popular game. The goal is to connect four pieces of the same color. On click, the color of the piece toggles and who is to connect four pieces of the same color is the winner.
#### Approach
My goal was to separate every action of the logic to a different function.
The Board is dynamically created on the invocation of the  ```init()``` function, all cells are assigned with id that corresponds to row and column for easy navigation through the board and implementation checkWin functions.
#### Technologies used
Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS.
